## Installation and building

- fork the [upstream repo](https://github.com/desertrat-io/fenpdf)
- clone the repo to your local directory that you'll be working in
- yarn install (make sure you have node and yarn installed)

And that's really it. Simple right? So far at least x.x

## Style

There is an eslint config file in this project that must be used at all times when writing both library code as well as
test code. Enable eslint support in your IDE and it should autosuggest or flag problems in your code. There is also an
npm command available to run the linter.


## Writing tests

Tests are required for all functionality added at all times. More guidelines on testing to come.
